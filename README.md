### Hi I am Reza 👋

Since I clicked play on my first HTML tutorial video, I can’t get enough of Front End Development. It calls to all my passions; it incorporates creativity, multi-tasking, and problem solving. Plus, it’s oddly satisfying when you bring ideads to life and build new experiences by writing and structuring bunch of codes.  

I am a highly organized person and love learning new skills. So far I have HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, SASS, and Git/GitHub under my belt and working on Bootsrap. I forgot to mention that I Possess a thorough knowledge of Adobe Photoshop.  

There’s certainly yet more to learn and yet more to build. And for this, I’m very grateful.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on some JavaScript projects to hone my skills
- 🌱 I’m currently learning React.js
