### Hi I am Reza ðŸ‘‹

Since I clicked play on my first HTML tutorial video, I canâ€™t get enough of Front End Development. It calls to all my passions; it incorporates creativity. multi-tasking, and problem solving. Plus, itâ€™s oddly satisfying when you watch how all the codes that youâ€™ve written make a web page to become alive and used by many people.  

I am a highly organized person and love learning new skills. So far I have HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, PostCSS, and Git/GitHub under my belt. I forgot to mention that I Possess a thorough knowledge of Adobe Photoshop.  

Thereâ€™s certainly yet more to learn and yet more to build. And for this, Iâ€™m very grateful.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on some JavaScript projects to hone my skills
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning React.js
