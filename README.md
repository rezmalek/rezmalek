### Hi I am Reza 👋

## Creating is my motivation 💪🏼

Since I clicked play on my first HTML tutorial video, I can’t get enough of Front End Development. It calls to all my passions, becaue it incorporates creativity, multi-tasking, and problem solving. Plus, it’s oddly satisfying when you bring ideads to life and build new experiences by writing bunch of codes.  

I am a highly organized person and love learning new skills. So far I have HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, SASS, and Git/GitHub under my belt and currently I am working on React. I forgot to mention that I Possess a thorough knowledge of Adobe Photoshop.  

There’s certainly yet more to learn and yet more to build. And for this, I’m very grateful.
