### Hi I am RezMalek ðŸ‘‹

I always thought my dream was to be a professional photographer, I even started my own photography business and had worked for more than 5 years. But Iâ€™d been treading water and I kind of just felt meh. I yearned to learn more, yearned to learn something different.

And thatâ€™s when it happened; the spark I was missing ignited the instant I clicked play on my first HTML tutorial video. Since then, I canâ€™t get enough. Front End Development calls to all my passions; it incorporates creativity and problem solving. Itâ€™s oddly satisfying when you watch how all the codes that youâ€™ve written make a web page to become alive and used by many people.  

I am a highly organized person and love learning new skills. So far I have HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, PostCSS, and Git/GitHub under my belt. I forgot to mention that I Possess a thorough knowledge of Adobe Photoshop.  

Thereâ€™s certainly yet more to learn and yet more to build. And for this, Iâ€™m very grateful.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on some simple JavaScript projects to hone my skills
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning React.js
